## Usage
To pull this repos and bring it locally, go into the folder of your choise and do a
> `git clone git@github.com:DocDanouBot/ICS5111.git`

regular git-usage rules apply. I think as you are all invited, you can add your own ssh-key within our own accounts. I suppose that this is independent from this repos.
